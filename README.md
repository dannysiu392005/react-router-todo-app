# React Router Todo App
This repo is the source code of a simple todo-app built using React Router (and [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)) when I tried to learn React. You can find the live demo [here](https://dannysiu392005.github.io/react-router-todo-app-demo/).
